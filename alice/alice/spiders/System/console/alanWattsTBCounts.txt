stripped when the joker sees a person taking his life seriously and regarding himself as extremely important there is something a little bit funny about it and he is inclined to get the giggles
stripped i discuss a point of view the jokers point of view from which not only our social institutions but also all the formations of the natural world are seen as games
stripped be careful of the word game
stripped it does not mean as trivialities because when we say it is just a game this often means it is just trivial
stripped there can be important games as when we play the piano or musical instrument we are not necessarily doing something frivolus but we are playing and there is something in the nature of all play that is not serious but at the same time might be sincere and i try to give you the picture of the multiplicity of natural forms on the one hand and of human social institutions and all the things we do and consider important and busy ourselves with as human beings
stripped i try to give you the point of view from which these can be seen as games
stripped as things being done as it was simply for themselves and not for some ulterior motive and therefore these games are in a way best played when they are played as games
stripped although it is really alright that people take them seriously except that they are a little bit deprived they are missing something
stripped and so when the joker sees a person taking his life seriously and regarding himself as extremely important there is something funny about it and he is inclined to get the giggles
stripped he knows that the very intensity of seriousness with which the individuals concerned are taking these games will be a kind of foil for the subsequent bursting into laughter when he sees that it was not serious after all
stripped you see that
stripped you might say that there are these two classes of people
stripped there are the very far out people and the very far in people
stripped now ordinary we say that someone is very far out when they are odd balls when they are exceedingly unconventional
stripped but i want you to turn the picture around and look at the conventional person look at the square as a person that is very far out
stripped that is to say he is so involved in the seriousness of the game he is playing that he is lost
stripped he does not know where he started from and he think is there ha ha ha ha
stripped but he is completely lost
stripped because he is actually under the cover of his assurance of his status of his position in the society
stripped he is really a very anxious person
stripped our society shows anxiety because it cannot permit the existence of people who do not belong
stripped and it cannot really permit the criticism of laughter
stripped it cannot permit the presence of the old fashion court jester
stripped because these people are so far out
stripped they are so involved and from a certain standpoint from the jokers standpoint
stripped he does not condemn such people he rather congratulates them on their heroism for getting so lost and involved
stripped but to keep the far out people of going quite insane there have to be far in people and the far in people are those who keep contact with the original goings on behind the scene
stripped they are like the prompter in the theatre where there are the actors out on the stage relying on their memory etc
stripped and they are supposed to be completely involved in the game
stripped but there is a concealed prompter with a script in front of him and he is the connection of the actor on the stage with the green room behind the stage
stripped there is  a cunning manner of becoming a budda and that is to become one instantly without any preparation whatsoever
stripped this is why zen is called the sudden school and why satori is a sudden awakening
stripped because it has to be done without the slightest warning
stripped now
stripped but then i pointed out that the moment you have any idea about doing this you have already ceased to be sudden
stripped that is to say the moment you seek for some spiritual attainment which is becoming a budda becoming awakened becoming released getting in there you have already served notice upon your creditors so that somehow or other you have to do it without intending to do it
stripped and that is a double bind which you oppose upon yourself when you say‚Äù i must find a way of doing this spontaneously
stripped that is the old old basic double bind
stripped you must be spontaneous
